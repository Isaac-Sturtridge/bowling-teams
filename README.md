# bowling-teams
An app for sorting bowling teams - given each player's average, sort them into even teams with the smallest difference between them.

Current use case expects less than 10 players, any more would be sorted into 3 teams. Smallest difference is not currently guaranteed, but highly likely - a small difference is all that is desired, smallest or not.

Scalability of formula is unlikely to need to be higher than 20 players.
